    ```
    **if `FATAL: Peer authentication failed for user "postgres"` arises refer to this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18664074/getting-error-peer-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres-when-trying-to-ge) and [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18664074/getting-error-peer-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres-when-trying-to-ge)**

* ### 5. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   apt install python3-venv
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

* ### 6. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


* ### 7. **create`.env` file**:
    create an app password using this [link](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords?pli=1&rapt=AEjHL4OOoBqDwmuaqYhjHZjIZ0LdXCFVqzXUcphwXe7ybYLEjhsgpT3swJEYpopNtN1pCtv7MiXSY9cxFSM1B2AJUujbVnp4vqXbyGa8qYDPEU_rpg13hmc) if you're using gmail.
    ```bash
    $# cat .env
    EMAIL_HOST_USER="your_email_host"
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD="application_password_created_above"
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL="default_email" # usually same as host
    ```

* ### 8. **migrate the tables**:
   ```bash
   python3.10 manage.py makemigrations
   python3.10 manage.py migrate
   ```
   if any error is encountered delete all migrations using the following command:
   `find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" ! -path "./.env/*" ! -name "__init__.py" -delete`.

   [then migrate the tables again.](#8-migrate-the-tables)


* ### 9. **Create a superuser**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
    and enter your credentials for this superuser/admin account.

* ### 10. **activate this new superuser**:
    a. open the psql shell:
    ```bash
    sudo psql -U postgres
    ```
    b. connect to the development database:
    ```psql
    postgres=# \c goodreads_clone_dev_db;
    ```
    c. change the `is_active` parameter in the table `users_customeuser`:
    ```psql
    goodreads_clone_dev_db=# update users_customuser set is_active = TRUE  where email='{EMAIL_USED_WHEN_CREATING_THE_SUPERUSER}';
    ```
    **NOTE: you can use any piece of credentials you want instead of email (e.g. id = 1, username = 'admin', ...etc.) run: `goodreads_clone_dev_db=# select * from users_customuser;`** to see the suitable piece of data for you


* ### 11. [Run the application](#running-the-application)


* ### 12. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) then login using the credentials you used with the command `python3.10 manage.py createsuperuser`

    ### ***AND NOW YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE ADMIN PANEL!!!***

## Running the Application
### 1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   python3.10 manage.py runserver;
   ```

### 2. **Access the application**:

#### a. use your preferred rest api access tool like postman or curl in terminal.
> **we recommend that you use the django rest-framework webpage (`http://localhost:8000/api/{ROUTE}/` or `http://localhost:8000/auth/{ROUTE}/`) in your browser or postman instead of the curl command in the terminal for ease of use.**

#### b. if you want to login immediately with the superuser account created earlier jump to step 4.
    
#### c. send a POST request to **`POST http://localhost:8000/auth/users/`**.
example:

```bash
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"username": "tester_user", "email": "tester@gmail.com", "password": "Pass#test123", "password_confirm": "Pass#test123", "first_name": "Test", "last_name": "User"}' http://localhost:8000/auth/users/
```

now this user (`tester_user`) will  receive an activation email on `tester@gmail.com` which will have an activation link like this:
    `http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/users/activation/MTA/cjb2x8-7ab038931019f4316ec8a816af90646a/`

### 3. from here we have 2 scenarios (since the application is not deployed yet):**

* email inbox is on the same device as the application --> just click on the activation link

* email inbox is not on the same device as the application. --> either activate by going to the admin panel, clicking on the new_user's id and editing `Active` parameter for this user, OR using the [psql command used in installation to create a super user](#10-activate-this-new-superuser)


### 4. Login and save the access token:

now send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/auth/jwt/create` with the email and password.
example:
```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d { "email": "tester@gmail.com", "password": "Pass#test123"} http://localhost:8000/auth/jwt/create/
```
which will result in a response like this:
```bash
{
"refresh":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoicmVmcmVzaCIsImV4cCI6MTczNzk4NzQ2NywiaWF0IjoxNzM3OTAxMDY3LCJqdGkiOiIxMTM3Yjg4MWRjYWM0MzhjOTI5YmQzOTNkM2E1YjBhYSIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjExfQ.2jy_R9-CNJAtx2SU8N4CFdHxjz-5C4hI3_T-CNzmiYI",

"access":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNzM3OTg3NDY3LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzc5MDEwNjcsImp0aSI6IjhkNTkxYzNiN2YxMTQyYWNiOWM2M2Y4YzNkYmU3MjZiIiwidXNlcl9pZCI6MTF9.DOqizcVDmlYcWb2efSZJUmOHazoaV9GTVeNMq1wtad0"
}
```
this access token will be used to access all the routes of the application.

### 5. adding the access token to all your requests.
any request from here on out must have the header:
```json
"Authorization": "JWT {ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```
- If in browser, download an extension that passes headers like [**Mod Header**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/modheader-modify-http-hea/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=en) and [**Header Editor**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/header-editor/eningockdidmgiojffjmkdblpjocbhgh?hl=en).

- If in postman, navigate to the `headers` tab and add a new header with the key `Authorization` and the value `"JWT {ACCESS_TOKEN}"`

- If using curl command:
    ```bash
    curl -H curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET -H "Authorization: JWT eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNzM3OTg3NDY3LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzc5MDEwNjcsImp0aSI6IjhkNTkxYzNiN2YxMTQyYWNiOWM2M2Y4YzNkYmU3MjZiIiwidXNlcl9pZCI6MTF9.DOqizcVDmlYcWb2efSZJUmOHazoaV9GTVeNMq1wtad0" http://localhost:8000/auth/users/me/
    ``` 
    and response should be like this:
    ```json
    
    {
        "id": 11,
        "username": "tester_user",
        "email": "tester@gmail.com",
        "first_name": "Test",
        "last_name": "User",
        "date_joined": "2025-01-26T13:01:53Z",
        "image": "http://localhost:8000/media/profile_pictures/tester_user/profile.png",
        "shelves": [
            {
                "id": 41,
                "name": "Read",
                "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/shelves/41/",
                "image": null
            },
            {
                "id": 42,
                "name": "Currently Reading",
                "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/shelves/42/",
                "image": null
            },
            {
                "id": 43,
                "name": "Want To Read",
                "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/shelves/43/",
                "image": null
            },
            {
                "id": 44,
                "name": "Favorites",
                "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/shelves/44/",
                "image": null
            }
        ],
        "is_staff": false
    }
    ```
    well I know it's not this clean but it's the same. ðŸ˜…

### **IMPORTANT NOTE**: most of the app won't work and you will get `401 Unauthorized` error  without using it


Again!! we recommend using the django rest-framework webpage (http://localhost:8000/api/{ROUTE}/ or http://localhost:8000/auth/{ROUTE}/) in your browser with a header extension as mentioned above or postman instead of the curl command in the terminal for ease of use.

don't forget to pass the header `"Authorization": "JWT {ACCESS_TOKEN}"`

### Book Routes (and their reviews)

note: to get the best out of the books route you should:

1. **Populate the books table using the script named `populate_books_data.py` by running `python3 manage.py shell` and pasting the content of the file.**
2. **Add admin or librarian privileges to the current logged in user**(if logged in as an admin/superuser ignore this), **by using the script named `populate_group_permissions.sql` to populate permissions tables and then going to the admin panel to add the new privileges to the logged in user**(you can simply do all this in the admin panel by creating a new group in the groups table with the desired permissions then add this new group to the user in the custom users table)

## Challenges and Solutions

### Issue with Applying Email Verification and Password Reset Features
**Challenge**: During the implementation of email verification and password reset, integrating with an email-sending service proved tricky. Setting up the email backend and ensuring emails were properly delivered to users' inboxes (not spam) required adjustments to configurations.

**Solution**: We used Django's and djoserâ€™s built-in email utilities. Configurations for email templates and backend were fine-tuned. Testing with multiple email accounts helped ensure consistent delivery.

### Dependencies and Environment Conflicts
**Challenge**: The backend developers were using different operating systemsâ€”one on Linux and the other on Windows with WSL. This caused compatibility issues with dependencies (e.g., some Python packages behaving differently across platforms).

**Solution**: We created two separate virtual environments for each OS, ensuring all required dependencies were correctly installed and configured. This avoided cross-platform conflicts without resorting to Docker.

**Challenge**: Having a hard time making hyperlinks for nested routes for the api in some apps due to bugs in django rest-framework.

**Solution**: Avoiding nested routes as much as possible and using other field options like dictionaries and strings.
